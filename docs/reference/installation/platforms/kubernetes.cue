				Our Helm chart deployments provide quality of life around setup and maintenance of
				metrics pipelines in Kubernetes. Each of the Helm charts provide an `internal_metrics`
				source and `prometheus` sink out of the box. Agent deployments also expose `host_metrics`
				via the same `prometheus` sink.

				Charts come with options to enable Prometheus integration via annotations or Prometheus Operator
				integration via PodMonitor. Thus, the Prometheus node_exporter agent is not required when the `host_metrics` source is
				enabled.
