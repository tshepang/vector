Vector is a high-performance observability data pipeline that puts organizations
in control of their observability data. [Collect][docs.sources],
[transform][docs.transforms], and [route][docs.sinks] all your logs, metrics,
and traces to any vendors you want today and any other vendors you may want
tomorrow. Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel data enrichment, and
data security where you need it, not where is most convenient for your vendors.
Open source and up to 10x faster than every alternative.

Vector is downloaded millions of times per month and relied on by companies
like T-Mobile, Comcast, Zendesk, and Discord to own their observability data.
